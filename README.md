# Health Monitoring System with Firebase Integration

This project is a health monitoring system that utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect data from various sensors, including a MAX30105 pulse oximeter, Adafruit MPU6050 accelerometer, and temperature sensor. Data collected includes heart rate, SpO2 (blood oxygen level), temperature, stress level, and step count. The data is then sent to a Firebase Realtime Database.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 or ESP8266
- MAX30105 Pulse Oximeter Sensor
- Adafruit MPU6050 Accelerometer and Gyroscope Sensor
- Jumper wires and breadboard for prototyping

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- WiFi library for ESP32/ESP8266
- [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database)

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/circuit12345/workers_health_monitor.git
   ```
2. **Install the required libraries** in the Arduino IDE:
   - `WiFi.h` for ESP32 or `ESP8266WiFi.h` for ESP8266.
   - `heartRate.h`, `MAX30105.h`, and `spo2_algorithm.h` for heart rate and SpO2 measurement.
   - `Adafruit_MPU6050` for accelerometer and gyroscope data.
   - `HTTPClient.h` for HTTP requests to Firebase.

3. **Upload the code**:
   - Open the project in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
   - Update the WiFi credentials and Firebase API details.
   - Connect the sensors as per your circuit design.
   - Upload the code to your ESP32 or ESP8266.

## Configuration

1. **WiFi Credentials**:
   Update your WiFi SSID and password in the following lines:
   ```cpp
   #define WIFI_SSID "Your_SSID"
   #define WIFI_PASSWORD "Your_PASSWORD"
   ```

2. **Firebase Configuration**:
   Add your Firebase project URL and API key:
   ```cpp
   const char* firebaseHost = "your-project.firebaseio.com";
   const char* firebaseApiKey = "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY";
   ```

## Usage
1. Power on the device.
2. The ESP32 connects to the specified WiFi network.
3. Once connected, the sensors begin collecting data on heart rate, SpO2, steps, temperature, and stress levels.
4. Every second, data is sent to Firebase, updating the current device data in the database.

## Project Structure

- `WiFi.h` - Library for WiFi connection.
- `heartRate.h`, `MAX30105.h`, `spo2_algorithm.h` - Libraries for pulse oximeter functions.
- `Wire.h` - Library for I2C communication.
- `Adafruit_MPU6050.h` - Library for accelerometer and gyroscope functions.
- `HTTPClient.h` - Library for sending HTTP requests to Firebase.
- Main loop:
  - Connects to WiFi
  - Collects sensor data
  - Calculates stress levels
  - Detects steps based on accelerometer data
  - Sends JSON data to Firebase via HTTP PUT request
